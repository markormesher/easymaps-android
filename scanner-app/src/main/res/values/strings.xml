	<string name="thanks_title">Thank You - You\'re Amazing!</string>
	<string name="thanks_body"><![CDATA[
		I really mean that - thank you so much for using this app and volunteering to collect data for my project.
		Hopefully, you\'ll be part of something that has a real-world impact, but there\'s more to it than that:
		what I\'m trying to build is pretty ambitious, and it will only work if I can collect lots of real-world data.
		Without you this project would be going nowhere, so I really mean it when I say \'thank you\'!

	<string name="instructions_title">Instructions</string>
	<string name="instructions_body_1"><![CDATA[
		Use the button at the top to enable scanning whenever you\'re travelling on the London Underground and disable it when you finish your journey.
		The scanner will run in the background, so you don\'t need to keep the app open.
	]]></string>
	<string name="instructions_body_2"><![CDATA[
		Don\'t worry if you forget to turn the scanner on before you start travelling!
		You can turn it on and off at any point, above ground or below.

	<string name="data_collection_title">Data Collection</string>
	<string name="data_collection_body"><![CDATA[
		Every 20-30 seconds whilst it\'s enabled, the app checks which WiFi networks are visible and records their IDs.
		This app also records a unique, anonymous ID for your device, which cannot be traced to your individual identity.
		That\'s all it collects - no personal data, no location data, nothing that can identify you, etc.
		You can see your ID by opening the app menu and tapping \'Display User ID\'.

	<string name="withdrawal_body"><![CDATA[
		If you want to withdraw from this project can do so by simply stopping your use of this app (and uninstalling it if you wish).
		If you also want to withdraw the data that you\'ve generated so far, you can do so anonymously from the app menu.
