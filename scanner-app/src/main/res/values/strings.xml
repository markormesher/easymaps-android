		<strong>Thank you!</strong> By using this app you\'re collecting data that will be used to build an intelligent, totally offline mapper for the London Underground.
	]]></string>
	<string name="intro_collection_text"><![CDATA[
		<strong>What data is collected?</strong> This app records a unique, anonymous ID for your device, and every 20-30 seconds whilst it\'s enabled it checks which WiFi networks are visible. That\'s it - no personal data, no location data, nothing that can identify you, etc.
	]]></string>
	<string name="intro_usage_text"><![CDATA[
		<strong>How do use the app?</strong> Just use the button at the top to enable scanning whenever you\'re travelling on the London Underground network, and disable it when you finish your journey; the scanner will run in the background, so you don\'t need to keep the app open.

	<string name="intro_ps_text"><![CDATA[
		PS. Don\'t worry if you forget to turn the scanner on before you start travelling! You can turn it on at any point, above ground or below.
